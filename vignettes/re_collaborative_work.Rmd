I collaborated with Sina Wermelinger.


## Person 1
I was Person 1 [here](https://github.com/ken-r/collaboration_2).

**Note**: I unintentionally created and pushed the new file for the step 
"Person 1 - Add a new file to your own project, and update the GitHub project."
too early (before merging the pull request), that's why I did it again after the PR.

## Person 2
I was Person 2 [here](https://github.com/Sinamariiaa/collaboration).
